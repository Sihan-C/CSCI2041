# Git Cheat Sheet 
 
1. pull：This command pull changes from the central repository down to your local one and updates the working copy of those    files in your account with the changes. It is used very often when we want to get the up-to-date changes in the files that we are working on.
2. add: This command add untrack files or modified files to the staging area. It is used very often when we modify or add a file in the repository. 
3. push: This command push the modified files or new files to the central repository after we commited them. It is used when we want to update the files in the central repository.
4. commit: This command commit the newly added untracked of modified files in the staging area and make then ready to be pushed to the centtral repository. The commit command adds your changes to your local repository only.
  (* TA COMMENT(zhan2361): Wording is a bit confusing. Untracked files will not be committed if you use 'git commit'. Come to the office hours (or email TAs) if you have any questions. The rest of description is correct. -2 *)

5. status: This command help us keeping check of what has been changed in our repository. It is used very often since it help us maintain our repository.
6. clone: The Git "clone" operation makes a copy of a repository and places it in your account. This copy contains the files and also all the history of changes---just like the repository stored on the central repository. It is often used when we want to start to contributing to one project. 
6. remote:To see which remote servers you have configured,you can run the git remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin – that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:
7. config: This command is used to set up your git. It is used not very often after we first setting up our git.
